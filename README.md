### A tutorial on how to mod a character into C:U, if the owner of the game wants this repo taken down, I will take it down

Also to note:
And also these sprites text for numbers location, Especially these: [float width and height], [TypelessData m_DataSize: UInt8 data: [3], [7], [15], [19], [27], [31], [39], [43]], [Rectf textureRect: float width and height], [Vector4f uvTransform: float y and w], This will give you some learn for numbers text.
